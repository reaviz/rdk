RDK is a set of low-level tools that implement common interactions found in
component libraries. The tooling abstracts the visual
presentation so the tools can be used with any visual presentation.

## ✨ Features

- Overlay - Provides a way to open floating panels on the screen
- Exit Listener - Provides a easy way to listen for exit events such as clicks and escape keypress.
- Portal - Provides a flexible system for rendering dynamic content into an application
- Position - Provides a flexible system for placing panels related to other elements
- Backdrop - Blocker element overlay

## 📦 Install

To use RDK in your project, install it via npm/yarn:

```
yarn add rdk
```

#### Development Builds
Our continuous integration server runs all tests on every commit to master and
if they pass it will publish a new development build to NPM and tag it with the `@dev` tag.
This means that if you want the bleeding edge of `rdk` you can simply do:

```bash
yarn add rdk@dev
```

This will install the version currently tagged as `@dev`. Your `package.json` file will be
locked to that specific version.

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "rdk": "3.0.0-dev-master.a0d076d"
  }
}
```

If you later want to again update to the bleeding edge, you will have to run the above command again.


## 🔭 Development

If you want to run RDK locally, its super easy!

- Clone the repo
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
